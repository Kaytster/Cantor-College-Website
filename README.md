# Cantor-College-Website
#### Web Development Project on Level 4 at Sheffield Hallam Uni.
I worked on this project from Sep 2024 to Dec 2024

###### Project Brief
For the project, we were required to create a website for a fictional college called Cantor College. The site could be built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and could include a simple connection to a database. CSS frameworks were not permitted. We also had a choice to use React.js and/or Next.js. All the text and images were provided, and we were encouraged to use as many as were appropriate for our design.

We were required to create: Wireframes, website code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript...), MySQL Database (with Next.js), and a lighthouse audit for accessibility. **This GitHub Repo only contains the Website Code and Database**

###### My Project
I chose to use Next.js for my website and connected it to a MySQL database.
The website consists of a homepage, a page for staff, a page for students, a page for businesses who want to work with the college, a contact page, an about page, a resources page, a facilities page and a courses page. The database consisted of information about the courses available.
